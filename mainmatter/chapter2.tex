\chapter[MECHANICS OF HARMONIC BASED EXTENDED TECHNIQUES]{Mechanics of Harmonic Based Extended Techniques}

\section{Overview}
Harmonic based techniques invariably make use of the harmonic series in one way or another. The harmonic series is a sequence of tones in which the frequency of each is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. The earliest forms of tuning systems were based around these, but modern instruments are tuned around equal temperament.
