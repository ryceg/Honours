\chapter{Assessment of Harmonic Based Techniques and Repertoire}

% TODO: Talk about Pythagoras.
Harmonic based techniques invariably make use of the harmonic series in one way or another. The harmonic series is a sequence of tones in which the frequency of each is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. The earliest forms of tuning systems were based around these, but modern instruments are tuned around equal temperament. The pitch of sound on stringed instruments is determined via tension, effecting the speed (and consequently pitch) the string vibrates at. Altering the tension is most commonly achieved via fingerings on the instrument's fingerboard, but bow pressure can also play a part in pitch production (see subharmonics).

To be able to pass any judgement on the techniques, we must first understand these techniques' capabilities, limitations, qualities, considerations, and values. Without references to other composers' works, any implication of authority on what constitutes as `idiomatic' writing is baseless. As such, references to other works will be used to support claims. Where no such references are available, it will be marked as the author's personal opinion.

\subsection{Background}
Provide an overlay of the techniques and explain how they work, the general benefits and such.
\subsection{Research statement/problem}
Techniques are under-developed and/or under-used.

\subsection{Aim and scope of thesis}
Examples of use in current literature will support use-case scenarios, dearths of usage will support the fact that they are underused.

\subsection{Significance of work}
The production of technique and its uses.

\section{Subharmonics}
% TODO: Explain subharmonics
First discovered by Mari Kimura, subharmonics are a type of overpressure which produces a sound lower than the fundamental.\autocite{kimuraHowProduceSubharmonics1999}  When the bow is drawn across the string, the drag of the bow twists the string, creating torsional oscillation. Under the right conditions, these can interact with the string to produce an identifiable pitch lower than the fundamental.\autocite{Subharmonics2006} Older strings work better for production of subharmonics, and the lower strings are more suitable due to the pressure needed.\autocite{kimuraHowProduceSubharmonics1999}


\subsection{Works featuring subharmonics}
One of the newest string techniques, subharmonics are still in their comparative infancy, and their notation has not been formalised. There have been several different ways of notating them, each with their advantages and disadvantages.
% TODO: Find pieces using subharmonics



Possibly the first person to make use of the technique, Crumb described what we know as subharmonics as `pedal tones'.\autocite{crumbBlackAngelsImages1971} The use of square noteheads and a separate stave for the resultant pitch makes the technique clear and readily understandable.

% TODO: Citation needed for Grisey

Gerard Grisey's \emph{Vortex Temporum} features overpressure, with a subharmonic of specifically a seventh. Somewhat abstracted out, this hides the intended effect behind symbols, and is slower to sight read.

    \caption{Excerpt from Kimura's \emph{Gemini}.}
\label{fig:Excerpt from Kimura's Gemini}
  \end{figure}
  % TODO: Citation needed for Gemini

  Mari Kimura's `Gemini' is an example of idiomatic usage of subharmonics on the violin. Kimura's notation practice of using a harmonic denoting the intended pitch below the fundamental is similar to the standard notation of harmonics, which Gould states is to `write harmonics as the player will finger them.'\autocite[413]{gouldBars2011} Unfortunately, this method proved somewhat counterintuitive in practice, as the notation was too similar, and caused sight reading issues.

  Botting notes that experimentations with octavic subharmonics yielded a pitch slightly flatter than an octave. He states \begin{quotation}
    `I developed a left hand finger technique whereby I rotate my hand slightly clockwise, pivoting on the finger stopping the string, which has the effect of sharpening the subharmonic enough to be more in tune with the fundamental.'\autocite[111]{bottingDevelopingPersonalVocabulary2019}
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Notation of Subharmonics}
Notationally, the best practice appears to be following Crumb's approach, condensing into one stave where possible. Musicians are better at sight reading above the stave than below the stave, so unlike natural harmonics, the need to split into another stave to show the resultant pitch is likely to be more common for composers wishing to use subharmonics. Below, I demonstrate the use of subharmonics twice in my work \emph{The Veldt}, for solo viola.

\section{Multiphonics}
% TODO: Explain multiphonics
Multiphonics are most commonly the domain of wind, and occasionally brass instruments, but they are an emerging technique in string writing. They are produced when fingerings split the string between two natural harmonics, allowing for the string to resonate at multiple frequencies.
% TODO: Citation needed for explanation
Multiphonics on stringed instruments are difficult, but with appropriate preparation and notation, are feasible. Production of multiphonics, as with wind instruments, is not guaranteed, and can be dependant on a variety of external factors, including the humidity, make of the instrument, bow used, and other variables that are outside of the control of a composer. 

% TODO: Expand Fallowfield discussion.
Fallowfield explores multiphonic production on the cello in her thesis CelloMap comprehensively, with video recordings of all possible multiphonics and permutations, including pizzicati.\autocite{fallowfieldCelloMapHandbook2009} These are isolated, though, and give little indication to the difficulty of the multiphonics.

\subsection{Notation of Multiphonics}

Thelin's thesis on double bass multiphonics states:
\begin{quotation}
    `Multiphonics is [sic] always notated with the harmonic diamond sign, in tablature notation
indicating finger positions rather than musical pitches. I suggest using the symbol M. above or
below the note to indicate that it is a multiphonic sound, together with the indication on which
string to play the note (in Roman numerals).'\autocite[6]{thelinMultiphonicsDoubleBass2011}
\end{quotation}

%   TODO: Reword Fallowfield dual harmonic positions
His notation suggestion is a somewhat less sophisticated version of Fallowfield's suggestion to notate the approximate pitch down to the cent necessary to produce the multiphonic. Due to the symmetry of the production of harmonics on the string, Fallowfield specifies both upper and lower positions necessary to produce the same multiphonic.\autocite[index/the-string/multiphonics-and-other-multiple-sounds/fingeringcharts.html]{fallowfieldCelloMap}

  We can see this in practice in Oliver Thurley's work for solo contrabass, \emph{yet another example of the porousness of certain borders}, where he adds another stave showing the intended pitches to be produced.\autocite{thurleyAnotherExamplePorousness2014}

\section{Half-Harmonics}
Half-harmonics is a term assigned to the fingering pressure found somewhere in between a regular note and harmonic. The timbral qualities of the half-harmonic are airier, with more white noise.

\section{Electronically-Assisted Harmonics}
% TODO: Expand electronic assisted harmonics.
The use of electronics to augment acoustic instruments is hardly a new technique, although their use in a live context is still relatively inaccessible. For my composition `The Veldt', I will be making use of Max MSP, a patch-based audiovisual processing application.
