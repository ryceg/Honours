\chapter{Experiments}
% TODO: See if this chapter is even necessary.
This is not totally set in stone; separating experiments out from compositions is perhaps unnecessary, as both will inform the other; techniques that I need to incorporate into my compositions will need to be experimented with, and techniques that I experiment with will invariably be linked with my compositions.
\subsection{Background}
Discuss these techniques in use-case scenarios, and find out whether there is an underlying reason for these techniques not being as common.
\subsection{Research statement/problem}
There needs to be more data about how these techniques work in order for composers to be able to make informed decisions about them.
\subsection{Aim and scope of thesis}
Experiments will yield data regarding the practicality and usefulness of these techniques.
\subsection{Significance of work}
By the end of this chapter, readers should learn what does and does not work with these techniques, and their limitations.
