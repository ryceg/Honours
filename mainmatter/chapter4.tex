\chapter{Findings and Research Implications}
This is where I will be presenting my research as a manual for composers.
Because my folio of works has some degree of overlap in usage of techniques, this chapter will deal with each technique, rather than be a review of findings from each piece singularly.
Where relevant, I will include my experiences working with performers.

Due to the limited number of permutations of these techniques, the Dick model of categorization is unnecessary, as space is not at a premium.\autocite{dickOtherFlute1989} 
It will also take into account how common the technique is, as well as notational challenges.

\section{Subharmonics} \label{sec:subharmonics}
Subharmonics are a difficult technique, that lend themselves to solo works, or works where they can be brought to the forefront.
They are notably different to overpressure, but bleed over into non-pitched overpressure is common.
This, plus the difficulty in their execution, makes them unsuitable for melodic content.

\begin{quotation}
  `To play subharmonics, one should place the bow at the 6th partial of the harmonic series of the fingered pitch, and bow with excessive pressure and an absolutely consistent speed. 
  The increased pressure will distort the vibration of the string, producing a phase loop which, in turn, produces the subharmonic. 
  Subharmonics are achieved through precise control of torsional oscillation, which usually produces the sound of an amateur string player's heavy handed, slow bowing. 
  The production of subharmonics can be aided by using older strings (which work better due to fats building up on the strings). 
  Making a counter-clockwise half-twist in the string can also make it easier to produce octave and major second subharmonics (additional twists can help achieve lower subharmonics, at the expense of higher ones).'
\end{quotation}

`In all cases for an octave subharmonic, the position will always be at the 6th partial of the harmonic series as it directly relates to the fingered pitch.'\autocite[]{longModernDoubleBass}

`Place the bow at the 6th partial of the harmonic series of the fingered pitch and bow with excessive pressure and an absolutely consistent speed. 
The increased pressure will distort the vibration of the string, producing a phase loop which, in turn, produces the subharmonic.'\autocite[]{longModernDoubleBass}

Curiously, older strings work better for production of subharmonics due to the fats that accumulate on the string, and the lower strings are more suitable due to the pressure needed.\autocite{kimuraHowProduceSubharmonics1999}
Composers looking to use this technique should be aware that it is not a standard technique, and instrumentalists will need copious amounts of practice and guidance in order to fully realise this technique.

\subsubsection{Instrument specific considerations for subharmonics}
Subharmonics are easier to produce on the contrabass with a lighter bow, preferably a cello bow, or alternatively a French style bow.\autocite[]{longSubharmonics2019}


\subsection{Notation of Subharmonics} \label{sec:notation-subharmonics}
Subharmonics should be notated with a square notehead, and a small notehead (optionally in parenthesis) at the desired pitch.
The technique description and notation should be included in the performance notes.
If the resultant pitch falls well outside the stave, a second stave can be used in the appropriate clef to ensure that the performer knows what pitch is intended, as seen in \autoref{fig:Excerpt from Risset's Variants}.\autocite[]{rissetVariants1995}
It should be noted that Risset's notation omits a fingered pitch, which is not recommended.

\end{itemize}

\section{Multiphonics} \label{sec:multiphonics}
Multiphonics are easier to achieve on larger instruments, due to the need for precise ratio-based fingering to achieve the resonance of multiple partials.
The technique description and notation should be included in the performance notes.

\begin{quotation}
  `Multiphonics are notated as a harmonic position, with an `M' and the string number (I-IV). 
  The theoretical sounding pitches are given in a bracketed staff above the main stave.
  String multiphonics are achieved through clusters of close harmonic nodes, and by playing a harmonic close to the highest partial.
  Above the sounding pitches, the sounding partials are given (i.e. M IV [4th + 13th + 9th + 15th + 5th]).
  Note that not all of these pitches will actually sound in practice.
  The bow should exert slightly more pressure than usual and should be drawn with a consistent speed which should be slower than for harmonics.'
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Notation of Multiphonics} \label{sec:notation-multiphonics}
Much has been written about multiphonics, and they are a well established technique in woodwind writing.
The notation between them differs, though; precise fingering charts above resultant pitches do not translate precisely into string writing.
Fallowfield's method of denoting the multiphonic with a diamond notehead is vastly preferable to the alternatives.

\section{Half-harmonics} \label{sec:half-harmonics}

\subsection{Notation of Half-harmonics} \label{sec:notation-half-harmonics}
Half-harmonics can be notated in one of several ways (see \autoref{fig:halfHarmonicNotationExamples}), but regardless of the chosen symbol, should be included and described in the performance notes.


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./resources/halfHarmonicNotationExamples.pdf}
    \caption{Half-harmonic notation examples} \label{fig:halfHarmonicNotationExamples}
  \end{figure}

It should be noted the first and last of the examples in \autoref{fig:halfHarmonicNotationExamples} do not have discrete noteheads for crotchets and minims like regular diamond noteheads.
As such, if there is rhythmic ambiguity, rhythms should be clarified above the stave as normal.
The first example, as seen in Sciarrino's \emph{Six Capricci for Violin} (\autoref{fig:sciarrinoExcerpt}) shows the ambiguity of this.
It should be noted that the `slant' of the regular harmonic notehead is opposite to the unfinished diamond, going from up to down.
This helps differentiate the two, but is perhaps not enough to make it easily distinguishable.

The second example unfortunately is not without issues, either; (\emph{normale}) harmonics denoted with a circle are exclusively for the resultant pitch.\autocite[419]{gouldBars2011} 
While half-harmonics \emph{do} produce the notated pitch, rapid transitions between half-harmonics and \emph{normale} harmonics using half-filled circles may cause confusion due to the translation between a symbol that denotes pressure needed and a resultant harmonic respectively, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:circleExample}
This is compounded by the circle notation's inability to handle harmonics that fall well outside the range of the staff (i.e. major 3rd and minor 3rd harmonics), resulting in a need for at least two types of notation; circular half-harmonics, and diamond noteheads for problematic \emph{normale} harmonics.

\begin{figure}
    % \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./resources/circleExample.pdf}
    \includegraphics[page=3,width=\textwidth]{resources/halfharmonicsExampleNotation.pdf}
    \caption{Half-harmonic circular notation} \label{fig:circleExample}
  \end{figure}

The third example of notation displayed in \autoref{fig:diamondSymbolNotation} is a non-standard symbol, and also suffers the same issues that plague the previous example.

\begin{figure}
  % \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./resources/circleExample.pdf}
  \includegraphics[page=4,width=\textwidth]{resources/halfharmonicsExampleNotation.pdf}
  \caption{Half-harmonic diamond symbol notation} \label{fig:diamondSymbolNotation}
\end{figure}

Appending text rather than a graphic may produce good results, as seen in \autoref{fig:textSymbolNotation}.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[page=1,width=\textwidth]{resources/halfharmonicsExampleNotation.pdf}
  \caption{Half-harmonic displayed with text} \label{fig:textSymbolNotation}
\end{figure}

Compare this with \autoref{fig:halfFilledNotation} and \autoref{fig:halfEmptyNotation}, which is an example of Sciarrino's half-empty notation as seen in \autoref{fig:sciarrinoExcerpt}.

\begin{figure}

  %   \caption{Half-harmonic diamond notation with circle notation} \label{fig:diamondExample2}
  % \end{figure}

% Further simplications on the stave are possible as evidenced in \autoref{fig:halfHarmonicNotationExample3} by denoting the string using text, or if sequential, lines.

It should be noted that the half-filled notehead as depicted in Gould and \autoref{fig:halfFilledNotation}, nor the Sciarrino style half-empty notehead as seen \autoref{fig:halfEmptyNotation} are not available in modern versions of Sibelius or Dorico as of the time of writing.\autocite[424]{gouldBars2011}
The flagship Standard Music Layout Font (SMuFL), Bravura, includes the half-harmonic circle as depicted in \autoref{fig:circleExample}, but is only available on Dorico and the Sibelius port of Bravura, Norfolk.\autocite[]{w3ccommitteeStandardMusicFont2019}
