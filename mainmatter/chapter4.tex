\chapter{Findings}
This is where I will be presenting my research as a manual for composers. 
It will follow the Dick model of categorization.\autocite{dickOtherFlute1989} 
It will also take into account how common the technique is, as well as notational challenges.

\subsection{Subharmonics}
Subharmonics are a difficult technique, that lend themselves to solo works, or works where they can be brought to the forefront.
They are notably different to overpressure, but bleed over into non-pitched overpressure is common.

This, plus the difficulty in their execution, makes them unsuitable for melodic content.

Players may find that subharmonics are easier on older strings, and they may also find that adding twists to the string may also help, or hinder the production of subharmonics, referencing the table below. 
Composers seeking to make use of subharmonics extensively may wish to consider the below table.

    Curiously, older strings work better for production of subharmonics due to the fats that accumulate on the string, and the lower strings are more suitable due to the pressure needed.\autocite{kimuraHowProduceSubharmonics1999}
Composers looking to use this technique should be aware that it is not a standard technique, and instrumentalists will need copious amounts of practice and guidance in order to fully realise this technique.

\subsubsection{Notation of Subharmonics}
Subharmonics should be notated with a square notehead, and a small notehead (optionally in parenthesis) at the desired pitch.
The technique description and notation should be included in the performance notes.

6 Caprices for subharmonics for solo violin, '97.
Gemini for solo violin, '93.
ALT in three movements for violin solo, '92.
Sonata No. 2 for violin and piano “Subharmonics” - Joshua Burel

\subsection{Multiphonics}
Multiphonics are easier to achieve on larger instruments, due to the need for precise ratio-based fingering to achieve the resonance of multiple partials.
The technique description and notation should be included in the performance notes.
