  abstract = {Subharmonics can extend the violin's range a full octave below the G string without changing the tuning. Additionally, by applying different amounts of pressure, an octave and almost all the chromatic intervals below the other fundamental notes can be played. Empirical data and elements for producing subharmonics, including bow location, pressure on the string, and the age of the string, are discussed. One curious discovery was that a twisted string works better. These different subharmonics for string players will also afford composers broader possibilities in creating their works.},

We undertake a comparative study of saxophone multiphonics from the musical, perceptual, and acoustical points of view. We propose four major classes based on the analysis of the musical attributes and playing techniques of a set of 118 alto saxophone multiphonics, spanning all the possible sonorities previously reported. Then, we perform a dissimilarity rating experiment for all possible pairs of a subset of 15 representative multiphonics. This experiment provides confidence in the suggested classification, since the four classes are segregated in a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) representation. We also find two possible acoustical correlates of the perceptual dimensions: the spectral centroid (SC) and the modulation frequency (MF). Finally, this last representation is explored through morphing trajectories, which correspond to multiphonics that change the timbre and musical interval organization with fixed fingering.

Overtone singing is where one person sings in two voices, the first voice represented by the fundamental and the second by an enhanced harmonic. Overtone singing is performed in chest register. Tuning of the first or second formant and a reduction of the formant bandwidth down to 20 Hz make harmonics prominent. Narrowing the pharynx, velar constriction, variation of the small mouth opening, and a tension of the walls of the mouth cavity are used. Changing prominent harmonics has the effect of creating an overtone melody with sustained tones, tone steps, and trillos.},

Clarinet Multiphonics is a multi-component thesis that looks into the entire area of
multiphonic analysis and composition for the bass clarinet. A literary section of the thesis
looks at past publications and the problems associated with using this contemporary
technique, in terms of both compositional and performance issues. A theoretical analysis
of Type One multiphonics gives an insight into how multiphonics on the bass clarinet work
in a more scientific way and their close relationship with the harmonic series. A complete
analysis of Type Two multiphonics using past charts and new-found fingerings results in
the creation of the new SW multiphonic charts for the bass clarinet. The new SW charts
are fully tested by correcting problems in past compositions by means of several student
compositional projects at various UK universities. Finally, a new set of études and pieces
have been commissioned by composers from the UK and abroad. The results and
successes of the pieces and new SW charts are analysed and can be listened to via
accompanying audio and data CDs.
The results of this thesis provide both performers and composers with an accurate,
exhaustive and up-to-date usable publication. Not only does this thesis provide a new set
of multiphonic charts, but the addition of compositional examples using multiphonics
provides both practice and recital material for performers and useful compositional
technique hints and advice for composers wishing to use this resource in the future.},

  shorttitle = {Breaking the Sound Barriers},
  abstract = {There was a drastic shift in the aesthetics of music from the twentieth century, and this placed new performance demands on musicians. These technical and expressive demands often include extended techniques, which are methods for producing novel timbres. This study undertakes an examination of these extended techniques on the viola. It is necessary for the modern violist to be familiar with extended techniques, but they are not part of standard training on the instrument, as the majority of the standard etudes come from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and do not address modern technical challenges. Because contemporary pedagogical literature is scarce for the viola and few etudes address extended techniques, six etudes have been commissioned as a practical application for this project. These etudes help to introduce and refine facility with extended techniques for students at an intermediate level.  
Extended techniques are often learned when a student is advanced, but they can and should be taught to younger students. The techniques are sometimes thought of as being unusual or challenging, but they are based on fundamental techniques and can contribute to and improve overall technical and musical abilities. This project begins with an introduction and a literature review, followed by the third chapter which provides a context for extended techniques with a brief history of the instrument and its pedagogy. The fourth chapter explores various extended techniques, the fifth chapter discusses the commissioned etudes, and the conclusion reiterates the importance of learning extended techniques.},

  abstract = {Parents in a futuristic society worry about their children's mental health when their new virtual reality nursery, which can produce any environment the children imagine, continually projects an African veldt, populated by lions feasting on carcasses. A child psychologist suggests that the automated house is not good for the children's development, nor the parents', and insists they disable the automation and take a vacation to become more self-sufficient. The children are not pleased with this decision, but later coolly agree to it. The children trap their parents in the nursery, where they become prey to the lions. They later have lunch on the veldt with the child psychologist, who sees the lions feasting, but does not recognize what has happened.},
